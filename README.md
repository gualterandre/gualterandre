### Hello there!

Welcome to my profile. My name is Gualter and I'm based in sunny Portugal.

I'm passionate about technology and helping out others. Drop me a message, let's connect!

## What are your primary goals as a human being?

Happiness. it doesn't matter what gets me up in the morning, as long as I'm happy doing it. Right now it's my family and learning about Web Development.

## What do you want us to know about your communication style?

- I tend to learn a lot over a short period which makes me dive deep into subjects, sometimes over the expense of everything else.
- I paste screenshots. A lot! My favorite action is: Take a screenshot of a section of your screen + paste it on a conversation/ticket to convey my line of thought
- When explaining something, I tend to ELI5 (https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/eli5/) a lot.

## What are some useful things to know in advance about your style?

- On a new environment, I tend to be shy at the beginning. Sometimes this is perceived as me being an introvert, which is not the case. Once you get to know me and our relationship evolves you will notice the difference :)
- I use my calendar a lot. I try to book every single slot on my week, even for personal tasks. Don't assume I'm not available on a particular slot (trust me, you'll know when I'm not available).

## How can you best work with me?

- Straightforward and sincere feedback. If I'm doing it wrong, tell me right away. I don't take it personally and always try to improve on honest criticism.
- Do praise me if I do something right or even excel at a particular task. But don't feel the need to do it more than once :)
- Want to show me something? Did I mention you can use screenshots for that?

## What are your pet peeves?

- Unclear thoughts or too much subjectiveness. I'm more of an objective person.

## What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?

- As much as I love web Development and software development in general, I lack the foundations to excel at this art. This is something I will be changing in the future, ideally as a self-taught engineer.
- Sometimes I feel overwhelmed when I push myself out of my comfort zone. This happens because I need to be fully aware of what is going on at all times and will not rest until I achieve that goal.
