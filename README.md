### Hello there!

Welcome to my profile. My name is Gualter and I'm based in sunny Portugal.

I'm passionate about technology and helping out others. I've seen Friends at least 5 times (team Chandler!) and am a huge fan of Marvel movies (I may like Captain America).

My dream is to buy a big house with a backyard for me and my family to live in (I currently live in a Condo).

Some of the things I enjoy:

- [British humor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n_Ty_72Qds)
- Chandler Bing's jokes!
- Eating [Francesinha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesinha)
- Cold over heat
- Maybe sarcasm.

Drop me a message, let's connect!

## What are your primary goals as a human being?

- Happiness. it doesn't matter what gets me up in the morning, as long as I'm happy doing it. Right now it's my family and learning about Web Development.
- Be kind to everyone.
- Equality. Everyone has a voice and should be able to express themselves.

## What do you want us to know about your communication style?

- I tend to learn a lot over a short period which makes me dive deep into subjects, sometimes over the expense of everything else.
- I paste screenshots. A lot! My favorite action is: Take a screenshot of a section of your screen + paste it on a conversation/ticket to convey my line of thought
- When explaining something, I tend to ELI5 (https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/eli5/) a lot.
- I'm sarcastic!

## What are some useful things to know in advance about your style?

- In a new environment, I tend to be shy at the beginning. Sometimes this is perceived as me being an introvert, which is not the case. Once you get to know me and our relationship evolves you will notice the difference :)
- I use my calendar a lot. I try to book every single slot on my week, even for personal tasks. Don't assume I'm not available on a particular slot (trust me, you'll know when I'm not available).

## How can you best work with me?

- Straightforward and sincere feedback. If I'm doing it wrong, tell me right away. I don't take it personally and always try to improve on honest criticism.
- Do praise me if I do something right or even excel at a particular task. But don't feel the need to do it more than once :)
- Want to show me something? To "convey your line of thought"? I wish there was a way to do this.....
- I do my best to learn about different cultures and how to talk to people. If I overstep or offend you in any way please let me know right away. I promise you it will only happen once.

## What are your pet peeves?

- Unclear thoughts or too much subjectiveness. I'm more of an objective person.
- Talking behind my back :/ Please, do it in front of me! Ideally, while drinking a coffee (or tea, if you're a team person. I can adjust!)

## What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?

- As much as I love web Development and software development in general, I lack the foundations to excel at this art. This is something I wish to change in the future, ideally as a self-taught engineer.
- Sometimes, I feel overwhelmed when I push myself out of my comfort zone. It happens because I need to be fully aware of my surroundings and will not rest until I master a concept.
- I wish I could start being myself right away. I'm very shy when I meet people for the first time but tend to be the exact opposite once I get to know you!
